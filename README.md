# Chess
Welcome to my Chess game!

# How to use:
Start Client.py and choose whatever mode you want too play,
Locally or Online.

## Online
If you want to play online take into consider that you may want to have a server running already so you can connect to it.
Once you got a server running you need to connect to it using 2 different Client.py instances

## Local
You just play vs yourself.

Hope you enjoy!
